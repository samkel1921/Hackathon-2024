What it does:
You can enter tasks that you need doing that then get added to a list, and when you complete them, you can click a button to remove them from the list.
How we built it:
I built it as a web app using React, using its in built features to accomplish the needed functionalities.
Challenges we ran into:
The main challenge I ran into was the process of deleting the tasks, as they are stored in a separate file from App.js and I was not familiar with how to properly pass information around files like that.
